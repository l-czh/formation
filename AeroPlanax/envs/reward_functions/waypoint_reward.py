    Reward function for waypoint navigation task.
    
    The reward consists of:
    1. Approach reward: positive reward when getting closer to the waypoint
    2. Distance penalty: negative reward when moving away from the waypoint
    3. Time penalty: small penalty for each step to encourage efficiency
    4. Waypoint bonus: large reward when reaching the waypoint
    5. Stability reward: reward for stable flight (not excessive roll, etc.)
